[ Prerequisities ]

auth_ldap is an authentication module for MySQL 5. Plugable
authentication is supported by MySQL from version 5.5.7 and up. Any
attempt to compile this module against MySQL source code older than that
will fail. Furthermore, in order to support LDAP connectivity the plugin
requires OpenLDAP library dynamically compiled. The plugin was tested to
compile against openldap-client-2.4.44 and libconfig-1.4.9_1.
It is unknown if it compiles with older versions.
This install guide is assuming you are using FreeBSD. It should also 
work for Linux too with some minor modifications.

[ Configuration ]

The plugin does support dynamic configuration through a configuration
file. Sample config file can be like following:

ldap:
{
	uri           = "ldaps://sample_ldap_server";
	dn            = "dc=sample_company,dc=com";
	cacert_file   = "/etc/ssl/ldap/ca.crt";
	bind_dn       = "uid=sample_user,dc=System,dc=sample_company,dc=com";
	bind_pw       = "sample_password";
	search_filter = "(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)";
	libldap       = "/usr/local/lib/libldap.so";
}

All config variables are required to set.
The config file name should be /usr/local/etc/mysql-auth_ldap.cfg.

= uri =

A URI is passed verbatim to the ldap_initialize function. The URI has
the form: schema://hostname:port. If other fields are present, the
behavior is undefined. 

Schema:
Apart from ldap, other (non-standard) recognized values of the schema
field are ldaps (LDAP over TLS), ldapi (LDAP over IPC), and cldap
(connectionless LDAP).

Hostname:
The hostname on which the LDAP server is running. The host parameter may
contain a blank-separated list of hosts to try to connect to, and each
host may optionally be of the form host:port.

Port:
The port number to which to connect. The port parameter is optional. If
it is not present the default LDAP port (389) will be used. However,
since the default LDAP port can be changed when compiling openLDAP, it
is highly recommended that you always specify the port number.

For more information regarding the URI please check the ldap_initialize
function man page:
http://linux.die.net/man/3/ldap_initialize

= dn =

The LDAP server base DN.

= cacert_file =

The CA certficate file that can be used via ldaps connection.

= bind_dn =

Low privileged user DN to login first and search through LDAP directories.

= bind_pw =

Low privileged user password.

= search_filter =

LDAP search filter. It can be like "(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)".

= libldap =

The location of the OpenLDAP dynamic library (.so). Failing to provide
the plugin with a correct path will led to errors during loading and a
non functional plugin. Please, provide a full path to the library.

[ Compiling ]

After configuring config file you can compile it by typing `gmake' in the
parent directory of the source. The build system will start with some
basic tests about OpenLDAP availability, API and will continue compiling
the module. This will create the auth_ldap.so plugin. All logs will be
written to syslog when it it running.

[ Installing ]

Type `gmake install' as a superuser to install the plugin. After, you
installed your plugin you can add a configuration directive your my.cnf
in order to instruct you server to load the plugin during initialization.
Edit your my.cnf and add the following line:

plugin-load=auth_ldap.so

under the [mysqld] section. You now must restart your MySQL server for
the plugin to load in this case.
You can also install it via mysql console:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN auth_ldap SONAME 'auth_ldap.so';

If you enabled DEBUG in source and compiled and installed, you should see something like
following lines, indicating that the plugin has loaded successfully:
...

Otherwise you should see something similar to following:

[ Troubleshooting ]

= Compilation errors =

/bin/sh: mysql_config: not found

If you are getting this error message, followed by a lot of compiler
errors this means that the build system is unable to locate the
mysql_config program. Under normal conditions this should be installed
in the system paths. First of all make sure you have MySQL installed in
your system. Then check if you can access mysql_config your self from
the console. If you can access it, then there is a problem with the
system paths during compilation. Please, find out the full path to your
config program by typing which mysql_config and the use the following
command for compiling the plugin:

gmake MYSQL_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/mysql_config

If you cannot access mysql_config from console then you will have to
locate it manually and give its path to the make program, by using the
forementioned command. Please, note that if some Linux distributions
have separate packages for runtime libraries and development files. Just
because you have installed MySQL to your system doesn't mean you have
the necessary development files installed. In Debian and Ubuntu you
should install libmysqlclient-dev package.

error: mysql/plugin_auth.h: No such file or directory

If you do not see a mysql_config: not found error and you are getting
this error, this probably means that you are trying to compile the
plugin against an old verion of MySQL. The plugin requires at least
version 5.5.7 to compile. You can check your MySQL version by typing 

mysql_config --version

in the console.

error: ldap.h: No such file or directory

You do not have OpenLDAP library installed, or it is not installed in
system standard paths. If you need to specify the path the library
header files are installed set the CFLAGS value when invoking make.
e.g.:

make CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include


[ Creating SQL users ]

After you have successfully installed and loaded the module, you must
create your database users. Unfortunately, there is not way to
automatically load username from the LDAP directory. Furthermore, the
plugin is called only when a user specified to authenticate with the
module tries to log in. All other users are left unaffected.

In order to create a user named bob, authenticated against the LDAP
directory, log in to your SQL server with an account having
administrative privileges and execute the following SQL command:

CREATE USER 'bob'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_ldap;

From now on, whenever user `bob' tries to login from localhost the
auth_ldap module is going to be invoked to handle authentication. You
can write a custom script to synchronize your LDAP users and MySQL users
and execute it via cron. Although this is sub-optimal, it is still
viable since you do not need to provide MySQL with a password for the
user. Therefore, your users can reuse their passwords. For more
information about MySQL plugable authentication please read MySQL
reference manual:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/pluggable-authentication.html

[ Make auth_ldap the default ]

Creating users using the IDENTIFIED WITH clause is mandatory for the
time being. MySQL doesn't support any means to configure the default
authentication plugin for the server. Scraping source code files we
found in file sql/sql_acl.cc line 180:

/// @todo make it configurable
LEX_STRING *default_auth_plugin_name= &native_password_plugin_name;

So you can see that the plugin name is hard coded in the source code.
Changing this to "auth_ldap" and recompiling might do the trick, but it
hasn't been tested.
